# Introduction to Deep Learning

In this repository, we introduce the basic principles of deep learning in an interactive pluto notebook.

To run this correctly, you must first install julia:

https://julialang.org/downloads/

Then clone the repo onto your local machine:

`git clone git@github.com:palma-ice/deeplearning_introduction.git`

Open a julia REPL within the repo on your local machine:

`cd deeplearning_introduction`

`julia`

Acces the package manager by pressing the `]`-key instantiate the packages provided in Project.toml:

`instantiate .`

You can now run Pluto within the REPL:

`import Pluto`

`Pluto.run()`

A link should appear in your terminal. You can open it in your browser with `ctrl+click`. Open `main.jl` and enjoy!
